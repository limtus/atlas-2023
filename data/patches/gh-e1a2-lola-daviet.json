	"description": "Lola Daviet was a 12 years old French girl who was raped and killed in October 2022. \nThe image was originally created by a french digital artist Laurel. The drawing was created by an independant french community, mostly composed of far-right users. It never stoped to be a controversed tribute among the french community since the murder of Lola was instrumentalized by the french far-right, because her abuser is an illegal algerian immigrant woman, later proven to be mentally ill.",
